# Case-control genetics datasets evolved to be epistatic

This repository contains the data for the following two studies:

1. [**Evolving hard problems: Generating human genetics datasets with a complex etiology**](https://doi.org/b44mk9)<br>
Daniel S. Himmelstein, Casey S. Greene, Jason H. Moore<br>
_BioData Mining_ (2011) DOI: 10.1186/1756-0381-4-21

2. [**A Model Free Method to Generate Human Genetics Datasets with Complex Gene-Disease Relationships**](https://doi.org/czh822)<br>
Casey S. Greene, Daniel S. Himmelstein, Jason H. Moore<br>
_Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning and Data Mining in Bioinformatics_ (2010) DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-12211-8_7

Previously, this data was hosted at http://discovery.dartmouth.edu/model_free_data/. As of July 2016, this repository is the preferred location as the legacy site is no longer supported.
